		<h1>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC <a href="LICENSE.html">LICENSE</a></h1>
<p>
Version 3, 29 June 2007
</p>
<p>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <<a
href="http://fsf.org/">fsf.org/</a>> Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.
</p>
<p>
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
</p>
<h2>0. Additional Definitions.</h2>
<p>
As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to
version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this
License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
</p>
<p>
An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface
provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of
using an interface provided by the Library.
</p>
<p>
A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with
which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked
Version&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means
the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based
on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
</p>
<p>
The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means
the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
</p>
<h2>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h2>
<p>
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
</p>
<h2>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h2>
<p>
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
</p>
<p>
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or
</p>
<p>
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.
</p>
<h2>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h2>
<p>
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code
under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is
not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in
length), you do both of the following:
</p>
<p>
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
</p>
<p>
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.
</p>
<h2>4. Combined Works.</h2>
<p>
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
</p>
<p>
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.
</p>
<p>
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.
</p>
<p>
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well
as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this
license document.
</p>
<p>
d) Do one of the following:
</p>
<p>
d.0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
</p>
<p>
d.1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user&#8217;s computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
</p>
<p>
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and
only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
(If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the
Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use
option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner
specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
</p>
<h2>5. Combined Libraries.</h2>
<p>
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side
by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are
not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a
combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the
following:
</p>
<p>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.
</p>
<p>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.
</p>
<h2>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h2>
<p>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
</p>
<p>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as
you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to it,
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
published version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy&#8217;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
